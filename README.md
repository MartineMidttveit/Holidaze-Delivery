# Holidaze

This project exam took place from October 14th to December 8th, marking the grand finale of my Frontend Development studies at Noroff School of Technology and Media. It's been a wild ride full of learning, a few 'aha!' moments, and plenty of coffee. While there were some challenges along the way, overall, it's been a blast – and I’m definitely leaving with more skills than I had when I started!

## Brief
"A newly launched accommodation booking site called Holidaze has approached you to develop a brand new front end for their application. While they have a list of required features, the design and user experience has not been specified. Working with the official API documentation, plan, design and build a modern front end accommodation booking application.

There are two aspects to this brief: the customer-facing side of the website where users can book holidays at a venue, and an admin-facing side of the website where users can register and manage venues and bookings at those venues".
